#AAD118 – Imaging and Data Visualisation

Imaging and Data Visualisation is a module that explores one of my favourite types of communication, non-verbal. Through only photographic, illustrative and diagrammatic ways a message must be portrayed. This could be difficult yet interesting to see the effects of what the pixels can do, from a perspective of a simple photograph to a purposeful mood board.

### Week One | Introduction to Photography

During the first week, we were given the introduction of what we will be undertaking throughout the next twelve weeks. We were given three projects to complete during this semester; a photographic pool, illustrative pool and a diagrammatic pool. For the first project the photography pool, we were given the task of studying architecture of some variety and photograph it from different perspectives. The photographs will be taken in macro and micro, a series of six photos for each section. 

The theme that we had to follow was architecture, which could be pretty much anything as it was such a broad spectrum to bide by. I initially thought of Belfast’s most iconic buildings and structures, such as the Belfast city hall, Stormont Estate, St Anne’s Cathedral, Grand Opera house, Albert Memorial clock, Belfast Castle, Titanic quarters, the famed Harland & Wolff’s twin Gantry cranes, and even the small alleyways and streets. I had a large amount of areas all over Northern Ireland that I could photograph, but I think Belfast has some of the best landmarks.

###Macro & Micro

The macro section involves capturing photographs of large spaces, showing vast areas from a distance. Many photos that I came across as macro would depict strong man-made objects and defined landforms throughout the world, but since my theme is architecture, I have to take pictures of buildings and structures and other manufactured objects created by man that are aesthetically pleasing. Macro photographs are usually are the exterior of the building, when taking pictures within a rural area sometimes the surrounding landscape is just as important as the piece of architecture itself.
For the micro section, I have to simply take photos that consist of close-up individual items or objects found within the area that were taken for the macro images.

###The Lighting

Lighting is an important aspect to photography, as lighting can completely change the mood and look to a photograph. Photography usually takes place in daylight, best in the morning and evening around an hour and a half after sunrise and before sunset. If photography is done during the night, the use of ambient light, streetlights and moonlight can also create a great effect.

###The Viewpoint

A photographs mood can change all down to the alteration of the angle and viewpoint it has been taken. When an image has been captured and the camera is placed on the ground, it gives the image a whole different look, as if the image is much larger, or that it is looking over you. The opposite action can apply as well, looking down at an image, making the subject look smaller or to get its viewpoint.

###The Rule of Thirds

The rule of thirds is a widely known system used by photographers, as a guideline it can enhance and add appeal to your photographs. When this principle is used the image is equally divided onto nine segments (3x3 grid), two vertical lines and two horizontal, this creates a grid that helps keep the photograph proportionally correct as the cross-section between the lines keeps the picture aligned. Most cameras, even phone cameras include this grid feature.

###Once you know the rules, break them.

>“There are no rules for good photographs, there are only good photographs.”
– *Ansel Adams*

From blurry images to strange angles, rules are there to be broken. Once we had learnt all about the guidelines that are out there for beginner photographers, we were allowed to ignore some of the most well known rules out there, such as the Rule of Thirds. It's all about experimenting!

###The History

The earliest known surviving photograph, ‘View from the Window at le Gras’ dated way back in 1826. It was captured by Joseph Niépce the French inventor and pioneer of photography. The photograph was taken on a photoengraved printing plate using a camera obscura.

### Famous Photographers

#### Ansel Adams

>“A true photograph need not to be explained, nor can it be contained in words”
–*Ansel Adams*

As an environmentalist and photographer Ansel Adams is famously known for his colourless landscape photos of the American West. In 1927, Ansel Adams produced and unleashed his first photographic portfolio, ‘Parmelian Prints of the High Sierras’.

###Week Two | Harmoney & Proportion

During this weeks lecture, we were taught about the harmony and proportion of photography.

##Photographers I have stumbled apon

### Laurence Winram

One of the photographers I have stumbled across this week is Laurence Winram. Winram is a Scottish photographer based in Edinburgh. I came across his work when flicking through images on Pinterest for some inspiration, I really love his collection ‘Edinburgh – Dead of Night’. They have really inspired me to take pictures of the streets in Belfast, I would like to get the enclosed dark feeling he has portrayed in his images, It would perhaps be best capturing pictures at night and relying on the ambient light to highlight nearby objects and cobblestones to get this effect. I have selected three of my favourite photographs taken by Laurence, I love the worn out decrepit look to the images, as it gives them a dated/vintage appeal that is quite prevalent in culture today.

###Bror Johansson

I came across Bror Johansson a Swedish amateur photographer, he mostly captures images of landscapes, but this one image called ‘Narrow street’ caught my eye, I like the angle he has taken the photo at as it leads your eye up the cobblestone path. I also like the strong contrast between the path and the surrounding area.

###Edward Steichen

Edward Steichen was a Luxembourgian American Photographer born in 1879. Steichen was known for his work being repeatedly featured in the magazine Camera work throughout 1903 to 1917. I came across one of his Photographs ‘New York City’ I love how the image has a blurred look, it gives an almost dream-like quality to the image.

###Brain Tuchalski

Brian Tuchalski is an amateur photographer from New York that is not very well known, but I stumbled across one of his photographs of the signage in Wall Street & Broadway in New York. I love the effect he has on the image as at first I thought this image was from a different decade, thinking it was dated way back into the 50’s, but in reality the photograph is relatively new.

I set myself a goal this week to take pictures of various signs, just like Brian Tuchalski. Botanic Gardens was one of the areas that I ventured to this week to take photographs, whilst on my hunt I came across various signs within the area. I also took pictures of other signs throughout Belfast, such as the Commercial Court. Once I had taken my images, I needed to create that dated vintage look to my images, I did this by using such software as using Picasa Photo Editor, Pixlr and Photoshop. I’m pretty happy with my outcome, as I think they look pretty dated. I particularly like the first image as some of the letters have came off the shop front, which gives the image more of a story and manifests questions, as to ‘where did the other letters go?’ and ‘What does it actually say?’.

###The Camera

The camera I have used throughout this project is a Fujifilm HS30 exr camera, I have also used my phone to capture photographs.

###Photo Time | Commercial Court

After researching and gathering photography tips, it was time to go out and start taking some pictures! Inspired by Laurence Winram I wanted to take night shots of streets, as I thought the streets are the true history of Belfast. As soon as the sun went down, I headed to Belfast and walked all around until I found the perfect place to start capturing my images. Commercial Court was the perfect place to start. As the hanging lights gave a great ambient light and bounced of the nearby objects in a dim but Christmas-tree-like way, it gave me slight nostalgia.

###Botanic Gardens

This week I went to the Botanic Gardens that is situated in Belfast City. I fancied going there to capture some photographs as I knew it had a historical Victorian green house that is still used today, it also has many other structures. I was hoping to go inside the green house to take some micro images, but sadly it was closed for the day, but I think I still got some shots of the building from the outside. There is slight juxtaposition to this building as it is so old, yet Belfast is growing up around it. I tried to capture that contrasting effect within the images.

###Week Three | Taking the Pictures

After experimenting and venturing to various places to find the images I was looking for, I finally realized that the theme of my photographs were going to be quite industrial and almost worn out looking. Coming from an industrial engineering background, I have grown up around industrialised things, such as oil tanks, machinery and various metals. So I think I’m attracted to that type of thing because maybe I see it to be quite comforting and sentimental... Not in a weird way, just in a way everyone feels when he or she sees something that reminds them of home or childhood. Some people had a swing in their back garden, I had a yard full of tanks and sheds to run around and play with. Totally safe.

So after my realisation, I set my goals to find worn out architecture around Belfast, much like the photographs I had taken on Commercial Street, only a little more. Dingy.

So I searched around alleyways and the back of buildings to find worn out stair wells, doors, fans and other things which I thought that looked quite battered and dilapidated looking. So after a day of taking pictures on my Fujifilm HS30 EXR camera and my smart phone, I transferred them over to my mac to edit them. Using software that I have previously used, such as Picasa, Photoshop and Pixlr I began to play about with filters and contrast of the images. I am quite fond of filters, sometimes I can over-do it so I have to really try and hold back, but that didn’t stop me adding some and playing about with the tones and other effects.

After playing about with the various editing tools and filters, I finally picked my final twelve Macro and Micro photographs. It was quite difficult to choose out of all the photographs I had taken, such as the Hillsborough Church, the remains of the castle, Botanic Gardens, and Commercial street. Along the way I have definitely learnt a few things, such as the Rule of Thirds, that you don’t have to have a fancy camera to take a good photo, lighting is very important, and not to over edit.

Out of Macro and Micro, I definitely enjoyed taking the Micro photos a lot more, as you could play about with the viewpoint a lot easier, create blurred effects, and just be a little but more creative with them. I prefer my Micro photographs to my Macro because I think they are a lot more interesting, as I think it is a lot harder to get a good Macro photograph because it can become to messy far to easily, also weather has a massive impact on it, as living in Northern Ireland, we are definitely not blessed with our climate. Most days are dreary and grey, but that didn’t stop me from editing in a blue sky into one or two of my other photographs. Although I favour my Micro photographs, I am still proud of the outcome of my Micro.
