<h1>Introduction to Photography</h1>
    
<p>
During the first week, we were given the introduction of what we will be undertaking throughout the next twelve weeks. We were given three projects to complete during this semester; a photographic pool, illustrative pool and a diagrammatic pool. For the first project the photography pool, we were given the task of studying architecture of some variety and photograph it from different perspectives. The photographs will be taken in macro and micro, a series of six photos for each section.
    
<br>
<br>

The theme that we had to follow was architecture, which could be pretty much anything as it was such a broad spectrum to bide by. I initially thought of Belfast’s most iconic buildings and structures, such as the Belfast city hall, Stormont Estate, St Anne’s Cathedral, Grand Opera house, Albert Memorial clock, Belfast Castle, Titanic quarters, the famed Harland & Wolff’s twin Gantry cranes, and even the small alleyways and streets. I had a large amount of areas all over Northern Ireland that I could photograph, but I think Belfast has some of the best landmarks. 

</p>  
    
    
<h2>Macro & Micro</h2>
    
<p>
   
The macro section involves capturing photographs of large spaces, showing vast areas from a distance. Many photos that I came across as macro would depict strong man-made objects and defined landforms throughout the world, but since my theme is architecture, I have to take pictures of buildings and structures and other manufactured objects created by man that are aesthetically pleasing. Macro photographs are usually are the exterior of the building, when taking pictures within a rural area sometimes the surrounding landscape is just as important as the piece of architecture itself.<br>
For the micro section, I have to simply take photos that consist of close-up individual items or objects found within the area that were taken for the macro images.
    

</p>
    
<h2>The Lighting</h2>
    
<p>Lighting is an important aspect to photography, as lighting can completely change the mood and look to a photograph. Photography usually takes place in daylight, best in the morning and evening around an hour and a half after sunrise and before sunset. If photography is done during the night, the use of ambient light, streetlights and moonlight can also create a great effect.</p>

<img class="night" src="images/night.jpg">

</div>
    
<h2>The Viewpoint.</h2>
    
<p>A photographs mood can change all down to the alteration of the angle and viewpoint it has been taken. When an image has been captured and the camera is placed on the ground, it gives the image a whole different look, as if the image is much larger, or that it is looking over you. The opposite action can apply as well, looking down at an image, making the subject look smaller or to get its viewpoint.</p>  
    
<div class="viewpoint-images">

<img class="viewpoint2" src="images/viewpoint2.JPG">

</div>
    
<h2>The Rule of Thirds.</h2>
    
<p>The rule of thirds is a widely known system used by photographers, as a guideline it can enhance and add appeal to your photographs. When this principle is used the image is equally divided onto nine segments (3x3 grid), two vertical lines and two horizontal, this creates a grid that helps keep the photograph proportionally correct as the cross-section between the lines keeps the picture aligned. Most cameras, even phone cameras include this grid feature.</p>

</div>  
    
<h2>Once you know the rules, break them.</h2>
<blockquote class="rules">“There are no rules for good photographs, there are only good photographs.”<br> <span class="name2">– Ansel Adams</span></blockquote>
    
<p>From blurry images to strange angles, rules are there to be broken. Once we had learnt all about the guidelines that are out there for beginner photographers, we were allowed to ignore some of the most well known rules out there, such as the Rule of Thirds. It's all about experimenting!</p>

<h2>The History</h2>
    
<p>The earliest known surviving photograph, ‘View from the Window at le Gras’ dated way back in 1826. It was captured by Joseph Niépce the French inventor and pioneer of photography. The photograph was taken on a photoengraved printing plate using a camera obscura.</p>
    
<h1>Local Photographers</h1>
    
<h2>Chris Hill</h2>
    
<p>Chris Hill is one of Irelands best photographers. He began a serious photography career during 1978 after being successful at taking theatre and sports photography. After some time Chris Hill managed to delve into many different types of photography ranging from fashion to food photography. His success is so closely followed that he was able to publish a series of books that were entitled Scenic Ireland.</p>
    
<br>


<p>During the last twenty years or so Chris has spent a lot of his time photographing for the northern Irish Tourist Board. He has also done a lot of work for the National Trust, illustration how good he really is. Chris Hill has contributed to the likes of The Visitors Guide to Northern Ireland, The Reader’s Guide to Ireland, The Insight Guide to Ireland and the Thomas Cook Guide to Ireland.</p>
    
<br>

<p>Personally, I think Chris Hills work is exceptional. You can tell that he really puts 110% into his work because it captures what every is in front of him to the best it can be. His composition is second to none and so many stories are told through his photographs.</p> 
    
<h2>Eve Arnold</h2>
    
<p>Born on 21st April 1912, Eve Arnold was a member of Magnum photos as well as an American photojournalist. A lot of her work was of well known figures through the late twentieth century. As well as this, she captured photos the people on the opposite end go the spectrum such as the poor.</p>

    <blockquote>"I don't see anybody as either ordinary or extraordinary…I see them simply as people in front of my lens.”<br><span class="name">-Eve Arnold</span></blockquote>

<p>Eve Arnold is probably best known for her amazing photographs of the gorgeous Marilyn Monroe . She had a friendship with her which allowed Eve to capture photos of Marilyn Monroe during her free time. These photos were something that the public or the paparazzi would never see and so this made Eve Arnold’s photos exclusive and memorable. <br>
    <br>

I think Eve Arnold’s work with Marilyn Monroe is beautiful. Eve Arnold really captures Marilyn Monroe’s personally and energy in the photographs which is sometimes hard to achieve.</p>
    
<h1>Famous Photographers</h1>


<blockquote class="rules"> “A true photograph need not to be explained, nor can it be contained in words”<br><span class="name2">–Ansel Adams</span></blockquote>    

<h2>Ansel Adams</h2>
    
<p>As an environmentalist and photographer Ansel Adams is famously known for his colourless landscape photos of the American West. In 1927, Ansel Adams produced and unleashed his first photographic portfolio, ‘Parmelian Prints of the High Sierras’.</p>
    
<h2>Aleksandr Rodchenko</h2>

<p>Aleksandr Rodchenko was a Russian artist, designer and photographer. He was also one of the key founders of the constructivism movement after the Russian revolution. Before getting into photography Aleksandr Rodchenko spent a lot of his time working within graphic design. Aleksandr Rodchenkos photographs have a particular style to them. His works plays around with strange angles which encourages viewers to look at things at a different perspective.</p> 

    <blockquote>"One has to take several different shots of a subject, from different points of view and in different situations, as if one examined it in the round rather than looked through the same key-hole again and again.”<br><span class="name">- Aleksandr Rodchenko</span></blockquote>


<p>I really like the style of Rodchenkos photos. His composition creates a really inserting view on everyday things which almost confuse us. I think that his background in design may have had an impact on his photography style in that he wanted to create pieces of art each time rather than just a photograph.</p>

<p>One of the photographers I have stumbled across this week is Laurence Winram. Winram is a Scottish photographer based in Edinburgh. I came across his work when flicking through images on Pinterest for some inspiration, I really love his collection ‘Edinburgh – Dead of Night’. They have really inspired me to take pictures of the streets in Belfast, I would like to get the enclosed dark feeling he has portrayed in his images, It would perhaps be best capturing pictures at night and relying on the ambient light to highlight nearby objects and cobblestones to get this effect. I have selected three of my favourite photographs taken by Laurence, I love the worn out decrepit look to the images, as it gives them a dated/vintage appeal that is quite prevalent in culture today.</p>

<p>I came across Bror Johansson a Swedish amateur photographer, he mostly captures images of landscapes, but this one image called ‘Narrow street’ caught my eye, I like the angle he has taken the photo at as it leads your eye up the cobblestone path. I also like the strong contrast between the path and the surrounding area. </p>

<h2>Edward Steichen</h2>
    
<p>Edward Steichen was a Luxembourgian American Photographer born in 1879. Steichen was known for his work being repeatedly featured in the magazine Camera work throughout 1903 to 1917. I came across one of his Photographs ‘New York City’ I love how the image has a blurred look, it gives an almost dream-like quality to the image.</p>

<h2>Brain Tuchalski</h2>
    
<p>Brian Tuchalski is an amateur photographer from New York that is not very well known, but I stumbled across one of his photographs of the signage in Wall Street & Broadway in New York. I love the effect he has on the image as at first I thought this image was from a different decade, thinking it was dated way back into the 50’s, but in reality the photograph is relatively new.
</p>
    
<div class="brian-images">

</div>
    
<p>I set myself a goal this week to take pictures of various signs, just like Brian Tuchalski.  Botanic Gardens was one of the areas that I ventured to this week to take photographs, whilst on my hunt I came across various signs within the area. I also took pictures of other signs throughout Belfast, such as the Commercial Court. Once I had taken my images, I needed to create that dated vintage look to my images, I did this by using such software as using Picasa Photo Editor, Pixlr and Photoshop. I’m pretty happy with my outcome, as I think they look pretty dated. I particularly like the first image as some of the letters have came off the shop front, which gives the image more of a story and manifests questions, as to ‘where did the other letters go?’ and ‘What does it actually say?’.</p>

<p>After researching and gathering photography tips, it was time to go out and start taking some pictures! Inspired by Laurence Winram I wanted to take night shots of streets, as I thought the streets are the true history of Belfast. As soon as the sun went down, I headed to Belfast and walked all around until I found the perfect place to start capturing my images. Commercial Court was the perfect place to start. As the hanging lights gave a great ambient light and bounced of the nearby objects in a dim but Christmas-tree-like way, it gave me slight nostalgia.</p>

<h2>Botanic Gardens</h2>
    
<p>This week I went to the Botanic Gardens that is situated in Belfast City. I fancied going there to capture some photographs as I knew it had a historical Victorian green house that is still used today, it also has many other structures. I was hoping to go inside the green house to take some micro images, but sadly it was closed for the day, but I think I still got some shots of the building from the outside. There is slight juxtaposition to this building as it is so old, yet Belfast is growing up around it. I tried to capture that contrasting effect within the images.</p>

<div class="part1">
    
<p>After experimenting and venturing to various places to find the images I was looking for, I finally realized that the theme of my photographs were going to be quite industrial and almost worn out looking. Coming from an industrial engineering background, I have grown up around industrialised things, such as oil tanks, machinery and various metals. So I think I’m attracted to that type of thing because maybe I see it to be quite comforting and sentimental... Not in a weird way, just in a way everyone feels when he or she sees something that reminds them of home or childhood. Some people had a swing in their back garden, I had a yard full of tanks and sheds to run around and play with. Totally safe.<br>

<br>So after my realisation, I set my goals to find worn out architecture around Belfast, much like the photographs I had taken on Commercial Street, only a little more. Dingy.<br>
<br>So I searched around alleyways and the back of buildings to find worn out stair wells, doors, fans and other things which I thought that looked quite battered and dilapidated looking. So after a day of taking pictures on my Fujifilm HS30 EXR camera and my smart phone, I transferred them over to my mac to edit them. Using software that I have previously used, such as Picasa, Photoshop and Pixlr I began to play about with filters and contrast of the images. I am quite fond of filters, sometimes I can over-do it so I have to really try and hold back, but that didn’t stop me adding some and playing about with the tones and other effects.<br>
    
<br>After playing about with the various editing tools and filters, I finally picked my final twelve Macro and Micro photographs. It was quite difficult to choose out of all the photographs I had taken, such as the Hillsborough Church, the remains of the castle, Botanic Gardens, and Commercial street. Along the way I have definitely learnt a few things, such as the Rule of Thirds, that you don’t have to have a fancy camera to take a good photo, lighting is very important, and not to over edit.<br>
    
<br>Out of Macro and Micro, I definitely enjoyed taking the Micro photos a lot more, as you could play about with the viewpoint a lot easier, create blurred effects, and just be a little but more creative with them. I prefer my Micro photographs to my Macro because I think they are a lot more interesting, as I think it is a lot harder to get a good Macro photograph because it can become to messy far to easily, also weather has a massive impact on it, as living in Northern Ireland, we are definitely not blessed with our climate. Most days are dreary and grey, but that didn’t stop me from editing in a blue sky into one or two of my other photographs. Although I favour my Micro photographs, I am still proud of the outcome of my Micro. </p>

<h1>Introduction to Illustration</h1>
    
<p>During week four the lecture was taken by Richard Weston, a graphic designer. During this lecture Richard explained and familiarised us to the idea of art direction. Art Direction is the process of making sure the work that you produce is beautiful, and is as effective as possible. It doesn't have to be a complex procedure. It can be the simplest things that evoke emotion and create that look and feel, such as using a certain filter or font. </p>

<h2>What is an art director?</h2>

<p>A Creative or art Director is a given role that is usually within in the design, entertainment and fashion industries. Throughout the years, art directors are becoming more popular within the web and graphic design industries, Paul Rand being a well-known example for this role. An art director is a position that is considered the top of the company when it comes to design. They have a great impact on the work that is produced. To be at this level it can take many years, many years of experience within the design industry is needed to achieve this position. The career is known to be a very challenging and stressful job, due to the extraordinary attention to detail that is essential. The purpose of the role is to lead teams of creative experts by working with them in order to produce excellent results for their clients. </p>

<p>Art Directors need to be able to communicate well within a group or team, so they would need to have exceptional presentation and communication skills, with the capability to listen, respond and relate to clients - in particular to explain things clearly to people who may not be very accustomed with multimedia and design products and solutions. Patience must be one of their qualities as they need to understand were others may be coming from when they are explain their ideas and concepts. Creative directors as well as art directors need to have a passion for design and an over all creative flair. They also need to have a great understanding of multiple programs such as the adobe creative suite. It is imperative that someone in this position is willing to keep up with technology as it progresses so that they are able to keep up with competition. </p>

<p>I believe that I could make a suitable art director or creative director in the future because I enjoy working with others and coalescing ideas to make an over all better product, also I think I am quite a good communicator. </p>

<blockquote> “A principle of identity between content and expression.”<br><span class="name">- Typographer, Jan Tschichold</span></blockquote>



<h2>Josef Müller-Brockmann</h2>

<p>Josef Müller-Brockmann is by far one of my favourite graphic designers, as I love his iconic block colour and use of typography that is seen within Swiss international style. The Swiss graphic designer and teacher was born in Rapperswil in 1914. Having studied architecture and history of art at the University of Kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich, he began his career by specialising in both photography and of graphic design. He was heavily influenced by art movements such as De Stijl and the Bauhaus which helped him create and develop his own style. </p>

<p>Several books were published by Josef Müller-Brockmann, such books including The Graphic Artist and His Problems, and Grid Systems in Graphic Design in 1961 where he explains his love for the grid system and how he uses it. Grid structures are heavily used with his work, this suggests that his architectural background was an influence, as ensuring everything was equal and correct was the upmost importance. Josef Muller-Brockmann is probably most well known for his use of simple designs that have the impression that they are random, but they are very accurately placed within a grid system. He used typography in such a clean and sophisticated way that it appeared so striking and effective that many designers still adapt his style today. </p>



<blockquote>“ The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee. It permits a number of possible uses and each designer can look for a solution appropriate to his personal style. But one must learn how to use the grid; it is an art that requires practice. ”<br><span class="name">- Josef Müller-Brockmann</span></blockquote>



<h2>Coralie Bickford-Smith</h2>

<p>Penguin books, are notorious for their various book cover designs, one of the most successful and talented book cover designers is Coralie Bickford-Smith. Having graduated from Reading university with a degree in typography and tragic communication she had the exception skills to produce the amazing work that she does today. She is currently working within Penguin Books and spends her days creating gorgeous new book covers and illustrations. Her work has been so fantastic that it has been highly recognised by the AIGA (NY) and her works has been featured in a number of magazines and newspapers all over the world. </p>

<h2>Saul Bass - Vertigo</h2>

<p>The dark eerie iconic title sequence for Vertigo is the he mixture of Bernard Herrmann’s soundtrack, the strange close ups of Kim Novak and spirographic imagery that makes up title sequence, which creates an iconic and enduring classic that will be remembered for even more decades to come. </p>

<p>Although the imagery contributed by John Whitney may seem a bit unrelated to the storyline of the movie, but they were justified by Soul Bass’ graphic direction along with the Bernard Herrmann’s lingering soundtrack. The optical illusion represent the effect of vertigo and resembles the iris, this results in the title sequence capturing the films theme using effective imagery combined with sound. </p>

<h3>We were advised to have a look at a few title sequences of movies. Title sequences can be an excellent source of the movies art direction, disposition and atmosphere. </h3>

<h2>Kyle Cooper’s Se7en</h2>

<p>The title sequence for the movie Se7en (1995) directed by Kyle Cooper compels a very dark and sinister feel to it. It has been so well done that it portrays the mood and the atmosphere of the entire movie perfectly. The sequence combines the almost surreal and alien photography by Joel-Peter Whitkin and the experimental filmmaking of Stan Brakhage. </p>    

<p>The title sequence is Cooper’s amazing visual interpretation of the films narrative, which is done perfectly. His interpretation was very effective with the use of haunting imagery, eerie score soundtrack and perfectly matched typography. This title sequence is so haunting and different that it will be remembered for decades to come. </p>

<h2>Geefwee Boedoe’s Monsters Inc</h2>

<p>Monsters Inc is a movie that I saw as a child, and i still remember the opening credits to this day. They are so effective and playful which capture the feel of the movie perfectly. The graphics appear in time with the music which works very well especially with the audience of children. </p>

<h2>Project 2 Brief</h2>

    <p>For the illustrative section of this assignment I will be undertaking a series of three book covers that I have to design, I have to select a genre from a list given, the categories are; Horror, Romance, Crime & Thrillers, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Children’s Classics.</p>

<br>    

<p>Alternatively, I could choose a specific author and create book covers for a number of their books. Creating book covers is something that I think will really benefit me. I thought that this was a really good point because within the industry I could be working with either print projects or web projects. </p>

<p>When I was first given this brief I had tons of ideas floating around my head, straight away I was thinking about the bookshelves in shops such as Easons thinking about how they look and how the mood is portrayed. We were advised to keep in mind how our book covers would look to a customer if they were on an online store such as Amazon. </p>

</div>
    
<h1>Progression</h1>
    
<p>After researching various book covers and artists last week, I have began looking at books that I think I would like to create book covers for. One of the book series I have experimented with is The Hunger Games.</p>
    
<h1>The Hunger Games Series</h1>
    
<p>I choose to create book covers for The Hunger Games series because they are one of my favourite book series. I have read the books a few times now and know the story pretty well and so i though this was a good benefit to have before design the covers. I thought the original books covers were a tad boring and i wanted to inject a little more curiosity and imagination to them.The mocking jay is the main symbol that portrays the entire story and so I decided to draw a mocking jay using pencil. After drawing it i scanned it in and edited it using illustrator. I wanted to create an almost tattered and destroyed look to portray the feeling of loss and damage which is frequent within the books. By using subtle colours along with the bird drawing I think I captured this feeling quite well.</p>

<h1>The Lord of the Rings Series</h1>

<p>Lord of the Rings is another book series that I really enjoy. I really like the story and so i decided to create book covers for it also, from looking at the books that I already own and other book covers that artists have made on pinterest I decided to create a flat designed style, with muted colours. Using illustrator I created shapes and images that dipicted what the story was for each book. Once I created the first book I thought it was missing something, so I added a texture throughout the shapes to give it a sort of cut out look. I then used the font Amatic SC for the text on the book cover. If I had more time I would create my own text for this book as I think the text needed to be shaped within the images, but over all I am happy with my final outcome.</p>

<h1>Data Visualisation</h1>

<p>This week we were introduced to our final project which was to create an infographic or data visualisation that looked at global population. We were advised to research different types of infographics and data visualisations before beginning the task in order to help us understand what is required.</p>

<p>We were given a link to the data that we would be using from World Meters. This data is completely life and changes in real time. Therefore when it comes to creating my infographic or data visualisation I will need to screen shot the data I will be working from or keep the data as an estimate. We were told that we didn’t have to just stick to the data given to us and that we could research further and gather other information that we feel may be beneficial to include.</p>

<p>When it comes to the style of infographic or data visualisation it would be completely up to us in that we can decide how it look as well as what data will be included. We were directed towards a couple of contemporary visualisations to get our creative juices flowing.</p>

<p>The first one I looked at was tweenping.net. This is a live interactive infographic that displays where in the world tweets are coming from. As the day goes on and different parts of the world are asleep in their beds the other side of the world lights up with millions of tweets. I found this really interesting and intriguing to see which countries are the biggest tweeters such as New York, LA and the UK.</p>

<p>I then looked at an infographic was illustrates how different groups of people spend their day. I found this really interesting to see how different ages ranges and education can affect how people spend their day. I found it intrigued to see that people with an advanced degree spend a lot more time working and that people with more than two kids still spend a lot of time working.  I really liked how the infographic was interactive and how I could isolate a certain group to look at it a little closer. It was also interesting to see all of the different actives together to have an overall view of what everyone was doing at certain times of the day. For example at noon, most people would be in work. At around 9pm the majority of people are watching TV or movies.</p>

<p>I began researching infographics and data visualisations to get a better grasp of the kind of things that can be created. I found myself on Pinterest which had so many excellent examples that really inspired me. I found an infographic on the wonders Guide to London I really liked how this infographic was laid out and displayed. Its use of bright colours in a sophisticated way really made it stand out from all the rest. The graphics used on this infographic are created in a flat style which I quite like because they aren't too distracting from the text. The text and graphics work very well together in that the graphics illustrate the points made in the text. This is definitely a style that I would like to replicate in my own infographic.</p>

<h2>Designing and deceiving with Data</h2>

<p>This week we looked at Edward Tufte. We owe Edward Tufte a lot as he was one of the first founders of data visualisation. A complete expert when it comes to presenting information in an effective graphical way. His membership with the American statistical Association demonstrates his exceptional skills when it comes to creating charts, graphs and diagrams to precision. He is a man that is obsessed with perfection as well as uniqueness, he takes it to extreme and deletes almost every photograph that he takes as well as a lot of his written work. He works well of others feedback and from constructive criticism which allows him to step back and have a lot at what he could improve on.</p>

<p>Edward Tufte has spent so much time and effort working on visual literacy that he has even created some of his own terms for issues that he regularly comes across whilst critiquing design. The term ‘chartjunk’ was born when he came across so many useless and non-informative sections in information displays.</p>

<p>Edward Tufte has always been critical about Microsoft PowerPoint and his point was proved after the NASA Columbia Disaster. PowerPoints purpose was to be used as a way of information an audience about things and perhaps persuading them to think a certain way. PowerPoint should not have been used as a method of showing important technical details. Edward Tufte did an analysis on the NASA slide that was in question. This particular slide was overly crowd with information and included the important detail as small as possible as well as blurred. If this information had of been displayed correctly and effectively then perhaps lives could have been saved since the anomaly may have been noticed.</p> 

<blockquote>“Information designer Edward Tufte has claimed that the Challenger accident is an example of the problems that can occur from the lack of clarity in the presentation of information. He argues that if Morton Thiokol engineers had more clearly presented the data that they had on the relationship between low temperatures and burn-through in the solid rocket booster joints, they might have succeeded in persuading NASA managers to cancel the launch. To demonstrate this, he took all of the data he claimed the engineers had presented during the briefing, and reformatted it onto a single graph of O-ring damage versus external launch temperature, showing the effects of cold on the degree of O-ring damage. Tufte then placed the proposed launch of Challenger on the graph according to its predicted temperature at launch. According to Tufte, the launch temperature of Challenger was so far beyond from the coldest launch with the worst damage ever seen to date, that even a casual observer could have determined that the risk of disaster was severe.” <span class="name">-wikipedia</span> </blockquote>

<h2>The Art of Information</h2>

<p>During this weeks lecture we looked at the art of information. As someone with dyslexia the way information is presented to me determines how well I understand it. As a young designer, if information isn’t displayed in an attractive way my mind goes crazy. I personally think it is really important to display information is the most appropriate way possible in order to get the facts and meaning across to the viewer as quickly and effectively as possible. We looked at different designers and developers during the lecture that used different methods and styles in order to display information in the way that they think best suits.</p>

<p>We looked at the famous composer JoAnn Kuchera-Morin who is also a Professor of Media Arts and Technology. She and her team have developed the Allosphere Research Facility. I found this absolutely amazing and fascinating. We watched a video by TED talks of her expelling what the Allosphere was.  The allosphere is an interactive environment where engineers, scientists and designers have all worked together in order to create it. Combining these different skills together is one thing, but join forcing in order to create something that could so vastly change the way in which we display our data is amazing. JoAnn Kuchera-Morin explained to the audience about the new and developing technologies are could and are being used with this facility in order to make data presentable and understandable. Using interactive graphics that react in real time as well as music that is also controlled by the data creates an environment that is created completely by data and changes accordingly to the data results.</p>

<h2>The Jonny Cash Project</h2>

<p>We also looked at the Johnny Cash Project. Coming from a family that likes Johnny cash I was aware of this project but it was great seeing it again.This project was directed by Chris Milk and created by thousands. The Johnny Cash project is a great example of crowd sourcing. In this case it was Johnny Cash fans that were the key contributors to the project and if it wasn’t for them and their love for Johnny Cash, the project would have never of worked out. The project reflected Johnny’s last studio recorded album which had themes of everlasting life and mortality which effective so many people. As a global collective art project, anyone could participate. By using a single frame from the original music video the contributor would draw in their vision of Johnny Cash and then submit it in with the thousands of other portraits. Once completed, all complied together and played in time with the song the final result was absolutely perfect. Forever growing this project is a form of remembrance of Johnny Cash’s life as his fans knew and loved him and for them it is their little way of showing their respect and admiration.</p>

<h2>Unnumbered Sparks</h2>

<p>We looked at the Unnumbered Sparks project which combined the work of artists Janet Echelon and Arron Koblin. This project resulted in a huge installation that hung in the sky. It was completely interactive and could be controlled by visitors in real time via their mobile phones. At night, the sculpture literally showed it’s true colours where it was able to light up the sky with crowd controlled artwork that looked stunning. This is another great example of using crowds in order to make the artwork its own. If visitors did not interact with this sculpture it still would have been amazing, but viewers and visitors wouldn’t have been as interested and curious.</p>

<p>These projects really opened my eyes into the possibilities that combining data and design can take me. I like how these projects were made possible by the work of many people including thousands of random people that just sent a few minutes of their day on the project. If more effort is put into making data more accessible and presented in a more effective way I think that people will understand much more and will want to because they will find it a lot more interesting. Needless to say I will be looking for other similar projects over my time off in search of inspiration for my own projects.</p>

<h1>Final Infographic</h1>
    
<h2>Creating the Infographic</h2>

<p>From all the infographic research I began to sketch some ideas of what I wanted my infographic to look like. The overall look to my infographic was to be bright and colourful with flat form design, to give a general cheerful appearance to it. After figuring out my style, I began to create each section on illustrator separately before combining them all together to create the final infographic. I had to gather information for my infographic, I done this by looking on the worldometer, to which I was shocked by all the data as people were being born and dying more than one every second. </p>
