<h1>Week One | Introduction to Photography</h1>
    
<p>
During the first week, we were given the introduction of what we will be undertaking throughout the next twelve weeks. We were given three projects to complete during this semester; a photographic pool, illustrative pool and a diagrammatic pool. For the first project the photography pool, we were given the task of studying architecture of some variety and photograph it from different perspectives. The photographs will be taken in macro and micro, a series of six photos for each section.
    
<br>
<br>

The theme that we had to follow was architecture, which could be pretty much anything as it was such a broad spectrum to bide by. I initially thought of Belfast’s most iconic buildings and structures, such as the Belfast city hall, Stormont Estate, St Anne’s Cathedral, Grand Opera house, Albert Memorial clock, Belfast Castle, Titanic quarters, the famed Harland & Wolff’s twin Gantry cranes, and even the small alleyways and streets. I had a large amount of areas all over Northern Ireland that I could photograph, but I think Belfast has some of the best landmarks. 

</p>  
    
    
<h2>Macro & Micro</h2>
    
<p>
   
The macro section involves capturing photographs of large spaces, showing vast areas from a distance. Many photos that I came across as macro would depict strong man-made objects and defined landforms throughout the world, but since my theme is architecture, I have to take pictures of buildings and structures and other manufactured objects created by man that are aesthetically pleasing. Macro photographs are usually are the exterior of the building, when taking pictures within a rural area sometimes the surrounding landscape is just as important as the piece of architecture itself.<br>
For the micro section, I have to simply take photos that consist of close-up individual items or objects found within the area that were taken for the macro images.
    

</p>
    
<h2>The Lighting</h2>
    
<p>Lighting is an important aspect to photography, as lighting can completely change the mood and look to a photograph. Photography usually takes place in daylight, best in the morning and evening around an hour and a half after sunrise and before sunset. If photography is done during the night, the use of ambient light, streetlights and moonlight can also create a great effect.</p>

</div>
    
<h2>The Viewpoint.</h2>
    
<p>A photographs mood can change all down to the alteration of the angle and viewpoint it has been taken. When an image has been captured and the camera is placed on the ground, it gives the image a whole different look, as if the image is much larger, or that it is looking over you. The opposite action can apply as well, looking down at an image, making the subject look smaller or to get its viewpoint.</p>  
    
<div class="viewpoint-images">

<img class="viewpoint2" src="images/viewpoint2.JPG">

</div>
    
<h2>The Rule of Thirds.</h2>
    
<p>The rule of thirds is a widely known system used by photographers, as a guideline it can enhance and add appeal to your photographs. When this principle is used the image is equally divided onto nine segments (3x3 grid), two vertical lines and two horizontal, this creates a grid that helps keep the photograph proportionally correct as the cross-section between the lines keeps the picture aligned. Most cameras, even phone cameras include this grid feature.</p>

</div>  
    
<h2>Once you know the rules, break them.</h2>
<blockquote class="rules">“There are no rules for good photographs, there are only good photographs.”<br> <span class="name2">– Ansel Adams</span></blockquote>
    
<p>From blurry images to strange angles, rules are there to be broken. Once we had learnt all about the guidelines that are out there for beginner photographers, we were allowed to ignore some of the most well known rules out there, such as the Rule of Thirds. It's all about experimenting!</p>

<h2>The History</h2>
    
<p>The earliest known surviving photograph, ‘View from the Window at le Gras’ dated way back in 1826. It was captured by Joseph Niépce the French inventor and pioneer of photography. The photograph was taken on a photoengraved printing plate using a camera obscura.</p>
    
<h1>Local Photographers</h1>
    
<h2>Chris Hill</h2>
    
<p>Chris Hill is one of Irelands best photographers. He began a serious photography career during 1978 after being successful at taking theatre and sports photography. After some time Chris Hill managed to delve into many different types of photography ranging from fashion to food photography. His success is so closely followed that he was able to publish a series of books that were entitled Scenic Ireland.</p>
    
<br>


<p>During the last twenty years or so Chris has spent a lot of his time photographing for the northern Irish Tourist Board. He has also done a lot of work for the National Trust, illustration how good he really is. Chris Hill has contributed to the likes of The Visitors Guide to Northern Ireland, The Reader’s Guide to Ireland, The Insight Guide to Ireland and the Thomas Cook Guide to Ireland.</p>
    
<br>

<p>Personally, I think Chris Hills work is exceptional. You can tell that he really puts 110% into his work because it captures what every is in front of him to the best it can be. His composition is second to none and so many stories are told through his photographs.</p> 
    
<h2>Eve Arnold</h2>
    
<p>Born on 21st April 1912, Eve Arnold was a member of Magnum photos as well as an American photojournalist. A lot of her work was of well known figures through the late twentieth century. As well as this, she captured photos the people on the opposite end go the spectrum such as the poor.</p>

    <blockquote>"I don't see anybody as either ordinary or extraordinary…I see them simply as people in front of my lens.”<br><span class="name">-Eve Arnold</span></blockquote>

<p>Eve Arnold is probably best known for her amazing photographs of the gorgeous Marilyn Monroe . She had a friendship with her which allowed Eve to capture photos of Marilyn Monroe during her free time. These photos were something that the public or the paparazzi would never see and so this made Eve Arnold’s photos exclusive and memorable. <br>
    <br>

I think Eve Arnold’s work with Marilyn Monroe is beautiful. Eve Arnold really captures Marilyn Monroe’s personally and energy in the photographs which is sometimes hard to achieve.</p>
    
<h1>Famous Photographers</h1>


<blockquote class="rules"> “A true photograph need not to be explained, nor can it be contained in words”<br><span class="name2">–Ansel Adams</span></blockquote>    

<h2>Ansel Adams</h2>
    
<p>As an environmentalist and photographer Ansel Adams is famously known for his colourless landscape photos of the American West. In 1927, Ansel Adams produced and unleashed his first photographic portfolio, ‘Parmelian Prints of the High Sierras’.</p>
    
<h2>Aleksandr Rodchenko</h2>

<p>Aleksandr Rodchenko was a Russian artist, designer and photographer. He was also one of the key founders of the constructivism movement after the Russian revolution. Before getting into photography Aleksandr Rodchenko spent a lot of his time working within graphic design. Aleksandr Rodchenkos photographs have a particular style to them. His works plays around with strange angles which encourages viewers to look at things at a different perspective.</p> 

    <blockquote>"One has to take several different shots of a subject, from different points of view and in different situations, as if one examined it in the round rather than looked through the same key-hole again and again.”<br><span class="name">- Aleksandr Rodchenko</span></blockquote>


<p>I really like the style of Rodchenkos photos. His composition creates a really inserting view on everyday things which almost confuse us. I think that his background in design may have had an impact on his photography style in that he wanted to create pieces of art each time rather than just a photograph.</p>

<p>One of the photographers I have stumbled across this week is Laurence Winram. Winram is a Scottish photographer based in Edinburgh. I came across his work when flicking through images on Pinterest for some inspiration, I really love his collection ‘Edinburgh – Dead of Night’. They have really inspired me to take pictures of the streets in Belfast, I would like to get the enclosed dark feeling he has portrayed in his images, It would perhaps be best capturing pictures at night and relying on the ambient light to highlight nearby objects and cobblestones to get this effect. I have selected three of my favourite photographs taken by Laurence, I love the worn out decrepit look to the images, as it gives them a dated/vintage appeal that is quite prevalent in culture today.</p>

<p>I came across Bror Johansson a Swedish amateur photographer, he mostly captures images of landscapes, but this one image called ‘Narrow street’ caught my eye, I like the angle he has taken the photo at as it leads your eye up the cobblestone path. I also like the strong contrast between the path and the surrounding area. </p>

<h2>Edward Steichen</h2>
    
<p>Edward Steichen was a Luxembourgian American Photographer born in 1879. Steichen was known for his work being repeatedly featured in the magazine Camera work throughout 1903 to 1917. I came across one of his Photographs ‘New York City’ I love how the image has a blurred look, it gives an almost dream-like quality to the image.</p>

<h2>Brain Tuchalski</h2>
    
<p>Brian Tuchalski is an amateur photographer from New York that is not very well known, but I stumbled across one of his photographs of the signage in Wall Street & Broadway in New York. I love the effect he has on the image as at first I thought this image was from a different decade, thinking it was dated way back into the 50’s, but in reality the photograph is relatively new.
</p>

</div>
    
<p>I set myself a goal this week to take pictures of various signs, just like Brian Tuchalski.  Botanic Gardens was one of the areas that I ventured to this week to take photographs, whilst on my hunt I came across various signs within the area. I also took pictures of other signs throughout Belfast, such as the Commercial Court. Once I had taken my images, I needed to create that dated vintage look to my images, I did this by using such software as using Picasa Photo Editor, Pixlr and Photoshop. I’m pretty happy with my outcome, as I think they look pretty dated. I particularly like the first image as some of the letters have came off the shop front, which gives the image more of a story and manifests questions, as to ‘where did the other letters go?’ and ‘What does it actually say?’.</p>

<p>After researching and gathering photography tips, it was time to go out and start taking some pictures! Inspired by Laurence Winram I wanted to take night shots of streets, as I thought the streets are the true history of Belfast. As soon as the sun went down, I headed to Belfast and walked all around until I found the perfect place to start capturing my images. Commercial Court was the perfect place to start. As the hanging lights gave a great ambient light and bounced of the nearby objects in a dim but Christmas-tree-like way, it gave me slight nostalgia.</p>

<h2>Botanic Gardens</h2>
    
<p>This week I went to the Botanic Gardens that is situated in Belfast City. I fancied going there to capture some photographs as I knew it had a historical Victorian green house that is still used today, it also has many other structures. I was hoping to go inside the green house to take some micro images, but sadly it was closed for the day, but I think I still got some shots of the building from the outside. There is slight juxtaposition to this building as it is so old, yet Belfast is growing up around it. I tried to capture that contrasting effect within the images.</p>

<h1>Week Three |</h1>
    
<p>After experimenting and venturing to various places to find the images I was looking for, I finally realized that the theme of my photographs were going to be quite industrial and almost worn out looking. Coming from an industrial engineering background, I have grown up around industrialised things, such as oil tanks, machinery and various metals. So I think I’m attracted to that type of thing because maybe I see it to be quite comforting and sentimental... Not in a weird way, just in a way everyone feels when he or she sees something that reminds them of home or childhood. Some people had a swing in their back garden, I had a yard full of tanks and sheds to run around and play with. Totally safe.<br>

<br>So after my realisation, I set my goals to find worn out architecture around Belfast, much like the photographs I had taken on Commercial Street, only a little more. Dingy.<br>
<br>So I searched around alleyways and the back of buildings to find worn out stair wells, doors, fans and other things which I thought that looked quite battered and dilapidated looking. So after a day of taking pictures on my Fujifilm HS30 EXR camera and my smart phone, I transferred them over to my mac to edit them. Using software that I have previously used, such as Picasa, Photoshop and Pixlr I began to play about with filters and contrast of the images. I am quite fond of filters, sometimes I can over-do it so I have to really try and hold back, but that didn’t stop me adding some and playing about with the tones and other effects.<br>
    
<br>After playing about with the various editing tools and filters, I finally picked my final twelve Macro and Micro photographs. It was quite difficult to choose out of all the photographs I had taken, such as the Hillsborough Church, the remains of the castle, Botanic Gardens, and Commercial street. Along the way I have definitely learnt a few things, such as the Rule of Thirds, that you don’t have to have a fancy camera to take a good photo, lighting is very important, and not to over edit.<br>
    
<br>Out of Macro and Micro, I definitely enjoyed taking the Micro photos a lot more, as you could play about with the viewpoint a lot easier, create blurred effects, and just be a little but more creative with them. I prefer my Micro photographs to my Macro because I think they are a lot more interesting, as I think it is a lot harder to get a good Macro photograph because it can become to messy far to easily, also weather has a massive impact on it, as living in Northern Ireland, we are definitely not blessed with our climate. Most days are dreary and grey, but that didn’t stop me from editing in a blue sky into one or two of my other photographs. Although I favour my Micro photographs, I am still proud of the outcome of my Micro. </p>

<h1>Week Four | Introduction to Illustration</h1>
    
<p>During week four the lecture was taken by Richard Weston, a graphic designer. During this lecture Richard explained and familiarised us to the idea of art direction. Art Direction is the process of making sure the work that you produce is beautiful, and is as effective as possible. It doesn't have to be a complex procedure. It can be the simplest things that evoke emotion and create that look and feel, such as using a certain filter or font. </p>

<h2>What is an art director?</h2>

<p>A Creative or art Director is a given role that is usually within in the design, entertainment and fashion industries. Throughout the years, art directors are becoming more popular within the web and graphic design industries, Paul Rand being a well-known example for this role. An art director is a position that is considered the top of the company when it comes to design. They have a great impact on the work that is produced. To be at this level it can take many years, many years of experience within the design industry is needed to achieve this position. The career is known to be a very challenging and stressful job, due to the extraordinary attention to detail that is essential. The purpose of the role is to lead teams of creative experts by working with them in order to produce excellent results for their clients. </p>

<p>Art Directors need to be able to communicate well within a group or team, so they would need to have exceptional presentation and communication skills, with the capability to listen, respond and relate to clients - in particular to explain things clearly to people who may not be very accustomed with multimedia and design products and solutions. Patience must be one of their qualities as they need to understand were others may be coming from when they are explain their ideas and concepts. Creative directors as well as art directors need to have a passion for design and an over all creative flair. They also need to have a great understanding of multiple programs such as the adobe creative suite. It is imperative that someone in this position is willing to keep up with technology as it progresses so that they are able to keep up with competition. </p>

<p>I believe that I could make a suitable art director or creative director in the future because I enjoy working with others and coalescing ideas to make an over all better product, also I think I am quite a good communicator. </p>

<blockquote> “A principle of identity between content and expression.”<br><span class="name">- Typographer, Jan Tschichold</span></blockquote>



<h2>Josef Müller-Brockmann</h2>

<p>Josef Müller-Brockmann is by far one of my favourite graphic designers, as I love his iconic block colour and use of typography that is seen within Swiss international style. The Swiss graphic designer and teacher was born in Rapperswil in 1914. Having studied architecture and history of art at the University of Kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich, he began his career by specialising in both photography and of graphic design. He was heavily influenced by art movements such as De Stijl and the Bauhaus which helped him create and develop his own style. </p>

<p>Several books were published by Josef Müller-Brockmann, such books including The Graphic Artist and His Problems, and Grid Systems in Graphic Design in 1961 where he explains his love for the grid system and how he uses it. Grid structures are heavily used with his work, this suggests that his architectural background was an influence, as ensuring everything was equal and correct was the upmost importance. Josef Muller-Brockmann is probably most well known for his use of simple designs that have the impression that they are random, but they are very accurately placed within a grid system. He used typography in such a clean and sophisticated way that it appeared so striking and effective that many designers still adapt his style today. </p>



<blockquote>“ The grid system is an aid, not a guarantee. It permits a number of possible uses and each designer can look for a solution appropriate to his personal style. But one must learn how to use the grid; it is an art that requires practice. ”<br><span class="name">- Josef Müller-Brockmann</span></blockquote>



<h2>Coralie Bickford-Smith</h2>

<p>Penguin books, are notorious for their various book cover designs, one of the most successful and talented book cover designers is Coralie Bickford-Smith. Having graduated from Reading university with a degree in typography and tragic communication she had the exception skills to produce the amazing work that she does today. She is currently working within Penguin Books and spends her days creating gorgeous new book covers and illustrations. Her work has been so fantastic that it has been highly recognised by the AIGA (NY) and her works has been featured in a number of magazines and newspapers all over the world. </p>

<h2>Saul Bass - Vertigo</h2>

<p>The dark eerie iconic title sequence for Vertigo is the he mixture of Bernard Herrmann’s soundtrack, the strange close ups of Kim Novak and spirographic imagery that makes up title sequence, which creates an iconic and enduring classic that will be remembered for even more decades to come. </p>

<p>Although the imagery contributed by John Whitney may seem a bit unrelated to the storyline of the movie, but they were justified by Soul Bass’ graphic direction along with the Bernard Herrmann’s lingering soundtrack. The optical illusion represent the effect of vertigo and resembles the iris, this results in the title sequence capturing the films theme using effective imagery combined with sound. </p>

<h3>We were advised to have a look at a few title sequences of movies. Title sequences can be an excellent source of the movies art direction, disposition and atmosphere. </h3>

<h2>Kyle Cooper’s Se7en</h2>

<p>The title sequence for the movie Se7en (1995) directed by Kyle Cooper compels a very dark and sinister feel to it. It has been so well done that it portrays the mood and the atmosphere of the entire movie perfectly. The sequence combines the almost surreal and alien photography by Joel-Peter Whitkin and the experimental filmmaking of Stan Brakhage. </p>    

<p>The title sequence is Cooper’s amazing visual interpretation of the films narrative, which is done perfectly. His interpretation was very effective with the use of haunting imagery, eerie score soundtrack and perfectly matched typography. This title sequence is so haunting and different that it will be remembered for decades to come. </p>

<h2>Geefwee Boedoe’s Monsters Inc</h2>

<p>Monsters Inc is a movie that I saw as a child, and i still remember the opening credits to this day. They are so effective and playful which capture the feel of the movie perfectly. The graphics appear in time with the music which works very well especially with the audience of children. </p>

<h2>Project 2 Brief</h2>

    <p>For the illustrative section of this assignment I will be undertaking a series of three book covers that I have to design, I have to select a genre from a list given, the categories are; Horror, Romance, Crime & Thrillers, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Children’s Classics.</p>

<br>    

<p>Alternatively, I could choose a specific author and create book covers for a number of their books. Creating book covers is something that I think will really benefit me. I thought that this was a really good point because within the industry I could be working with either print projects or web projects. </p>

<p>When I was first given this brief I had tons of ideas floating around my head, straight away I was thinking about the bookshelves in shops such as Easons thinking about how they look and how the mood is portrayed. We were advised to keep in mind how our book covers would look to a customer if they were on an online store such as Amazon. </p>

<h1>week five | Progression</h1>
    
<p>After researching various book covers and artists last week, I have began looking at books that I think I would like to create book covers for. One of the book series I have experimented with is The Hunger Games.</p>
    
<h1>The Hunger Games Series</h1>
    
<p>The Hunger Games is one of my favourite book series I have read, as it is full of drama and conflict.</p>
